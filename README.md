# Chess Game (Console)

A simple console-based chess game written in C# for .NET 8 — playable locally with two players on the same machine.

## ✅ Features
- Console UI with UTF-8 board output
- Player vs Player (local) with move validation, check/checkmate and draw detection
- Score tracking during the session
- Implemented pieces: `Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Queen`, `King`

## ⚙️ Requirements
- .NET SDK 8.0 (Windows)

## ▶️ Build & run
From the project root (where `Chess Game.csproj` is located):

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project "Chess Game.csproj"
```

Or open `Chess Game.sln` in Visual Studio and press F5.

## 🎮 How to play
1. Start the app — you'll be prompted to enter each player's name.
2. On your turn you will be asked for:
   - `Enter square of the piece you want to move from:` (e.g. `E2`) 
   - `Enter square you want to move to:` (e.g. `E4`)
3. Input is case-insensitive. Invalid moves are rejected with a prompt to try again.
4. Game ends on checkmate, stalemate (draw), or when a player reaches the configured win condition.
